Runway documentation
==================================

What is Runway?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Runway is a lightweight wrapper around infrastructure deployment (e.g.
CloudFormation, Terraform, Serverless) & linting (e.g. yamllint) tools to ease
management of per-environment configs & deployment.

Why use Runway?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Very simple configuration to:

- Perform automatic linting/verification
- Ensure deployments are only performed when an environment config is present
- Define an IAM role to assume for each deployment
- Wrangle Terraform backend/workspace configs w/ per-environment tfvars
- Avoid long-term tool lock-in

  - Runway is a simple wrapper around standard tools. It simply helps to
    avoid convoluted Makefiles / CI jobs
